vim
----
Followed the instructions at http://sontek.net/blog/detail/turning-vim-into-a-modern-python-ide with a few customisations and changes of my own including:
* Using Vundle instead of pathogen
* Used CtrlP instead of command-t (no Rake dependency needed)

  (See README in _vim folder for more info)
